# Nature-scene-classification-using-fastai
The objective is to classify Multi-label images using deep learning. 
Here I have used Fastai library for implementing the model. 
Multi-class image classification is a good learning project for anyone who is getting started with deep learning, and fastai library makes the whole process quite easy for beginners.
I have used the Densenet-161 model to classify scenes divided into six different categories.
